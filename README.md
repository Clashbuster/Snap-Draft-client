## Snap Draft

## Mission
This is a rapid drafting platform being designed to maxmimize time management and productivity when writing novels

## Key features


While there are many features still in development, the core functionality of this project revolves around a sprinting environment and statistics page. Users can quickly and easily start new novels and begin completing sprints. At any time the user can go to the stats page and see a wide range of statistics about their novel so that they may gain some insight on how to move forward.

All of the writer's work is rendered seamlessly within Snap Draft's easy to use in-browser repository.

All of the submissions are held securely in the back-end of this project. Their work is not freely shared with third parties, so there is minimal risk of exposure. Naturally, this website could also serve as a back-up for the writer's work.

## Release date 

The site is currently under construction and should be deployed by march 2020


## UI experience

As a new User the first thing you are going to see after log in is an empty repositoryy with a "+" tag. The first thing you need to do is to click that tab so you can instantiate a new novel. The minimum requirements for a new novel is a unique title, and a numerical sprint increment. If you're not writing a novel, I cannot garauntee this website will be of use to you. You will be unable to access most of the features of the site without having at least one active novel in your repository.


After instantiating a novel a relative tab will appear with that novel's title. After selecting that new tab, the subsidiary navigational tabs will appear. At this point (and thereafter) you can freely toggle the tabs to switch between views and novels alike. The only thing that remains is to make progress on your work, view statistics as needed and to export the novel to docx when you feel it is ready to move into an editing phase.


Final words : While every user is free to edit a draft in progress, it is reccomended that the novel be drafted to completion before the writer transitions the work into editing. This way the writer remains focused and in pure creative mode for the length of the work. This is a proven method to boost long form productivity.
